smart trash can
Introduction:
The embedded system project to be designed and produced this time is a smart trash can. This is a small version of the smart trash can. First of all, he has a sensor switch, when it senses that you are about to throw out garbage. His lid will open automatically. This is the basic function of the smart trash can.

The purpose of the project:
By making related projects, you can improve your programming level. And can better understand what embedded system is. The smart trash can is a project close to our lives. It can better experience the convenience of human beings brought by embedded systems.


Here is the Materials and equipment you need for the project:
1. A small size trash can
2. Arduino Uno
3. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor（*2)
4. LDR Sensor Module Interface
5. DHT11 Temperature And Relative Humidity Sensor Module
6. LED 5mm （*5）
7. Male/Female Jumper Wires 
8. LCD1602A BLUEE SCREEN 
9. Servo Motor SG-90
10. Buzzer Active 5V Module （*2）
11. A Hot Glue Gun
12. Some paper boxes as auxiliary materials
