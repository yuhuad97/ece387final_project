smart trash can
Introduction:
The embedded system project to be designed and produced this time is a smart trash can. This is a small version of the smart trash can. First of all, he has a sensor switch, when it senses that you are about to throw out garbage. His lid will open automatically. This is the basic function of the smart trash can.

The purpose of the project:
By making related projects, you can improve your programming level. And can better understand what embedded system is. The smart trash can is a project close to our lives. It can better experience the convenience of human beings brought by embedded systems.

The equipment:
1.	Arduino Uno
2.	Laptop
3.	Motor
4.	Infrared sensor module
??
Enhanced Smart Trash Can:
It is a good idea to add more functional trash cans. So I will add a new feature here, that is, if it senses that the garbage is full, it will sound an alarm. If possible, I will increase its mobility.
